# Verified Functional Algorithms - Selection Chapter

**How to Run**
1. Install findlemma before running any tests.
2. `cd common` then `make && make install`
3. For each test, `cd tests && coqc <test>`

Note there is no script included to test all of the benchmarks in once; currently running individually.
